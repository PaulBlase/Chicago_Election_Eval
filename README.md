# Chicago Mayoral Races

### The Problem at Hand
Chicago, as one of the largest cities in the United States, is a seat of power for trade, culture, and politics. Focusing specifically at politics, and the unique system utilized in Chicago in this day and age, predictions on campaign outcomes and understanding the perogatives of ever-changing communities is essential to foreseeing problems in the city's landscape and how it adjusts to current and oncoming problems.

As evidenced by the most recent field of candidates for the mayor of Chicago, citizens of the city struggle with the corrupt nature of citywide politics and recognize the notoriety of several key figures for their roles in city policy, generally for the worst. A wide array of characters and backstories entered into the 2019 field. Ranging from perenial political figures to complete outsiders, the initial race drew over 540,784 voters to the polls, making it one of the highest turnout elections since the turn of the century.

However, there was a lack of consensus on candidate. Nine separate candidates received over 29,000 votes.

As we can see, a variety of different candidates with different backgrounds were amongst this group of nine. With that, we see distinct districts and interest from voters based on their background. But, with only Lori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle on the ballot come April, what can we say about the voters who participated in February and could this lead to some assessments we could make to predict the mayor of Chicago?

### Introducing the Data and Visualizations
Voting data was complied from all 50 wards, recorded to one of the 2069 precincts in the city of Chicago. Supplemented with demographic data provided by the census for each ward, we hope to visualize and understand how the most recent election and those run in 2015 might provide insight into the upcoming runoff on the 2nd of April.

Evaluating by precinct, we can identify a winner for each. We can also identify, assuming territory is maintained, battleground for the two remaining candidates.

Lightfoot was very successful motivating the Northside of Chicago, an area with generally high voter participation, to pull for her. However, this leaves a lot on the board elsewhere and, even with competition from a wide field, Preckwinkle was successful at pulling from districts around the city.

In evaluating them directly against each other, we see that Lightfoot remains strong on the Northside, while Preckwinkle holds an advantage on both the West and Southsides. While the Preckwinkle camp could have concerns over the turnout in the first election, as well as lower tendency of turnout from lower income voters (based on findings in 2015's runoff), the sheer volume of precincts she holds an advantage in likely bodes well for her. 

Additionally, we see areas of the city, such as Morgan Park, Oak Park, and Bridgeport, with some of the highest turnout not voting strongly toward either candidate. While this field of candidates like discourages the many voters for a Daley or Vallas, the number of voters first time around indicates at least a solid pool of voters to return to the polls. These should be pivotal campaign locations given the potential come April.
